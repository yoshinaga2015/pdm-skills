# UI Creation Skill

## Purpose
Apply A/B testing insights to first-pass UI design so new screens are easy to understand, commercially effective, and trustworthy from day one.

## When to Use
- Building a brand-new screen or flow for a new feature
- Creating new onboarding, landing, pricing, paywall, checkout, or PDP UI
- Drafting initial options for CTA copy, icon choice, pricing presentation, or form structure

## Execution Steps
1. **Define the screen's primary job**
   - Narrow the goal to one core action (for example, start trial, complete purchase, finish onboarding).
2. **Separate essential information from noise**
   - Split content into `must-have` (decision-critical) and `nice-to-have` (supporting).
   - Design for both clarity and persuasion; treat them as separate quality checks.
3. **Reduce flow friction early**
   - Keep early steps lightweight, and move heavy inputs later when possible.
   - Prefer `smart default + editable later` when it fits the product.
4. **Build trust and risk reduction into the UI**
   - Make pricing terms, billing timing, cancellation, and return/refund conditions explicit.
   - Place trust signals (reviews, guarantees, evidence) near primary CTAs.
5. **Prepare two persuasive angles**
   - Feature-led vs benefit-led
   - Rational appeal vs emotional appeal
   - Action-focused CTA vs value-focused CTA
6. **Output A/B-ready variants**
   - Always provide 2-3 variants (A: baseline-friendly / B: strong change / C: balanced option).

## Default Guidelines by Screen Type

### Onboarding
- Minimize forced choices and mandatory upfront input; surface value first.
- If collecting multiple intents, avoid choice overload and reflect results immediately.
- For checklist-style flows, keep only actions tied to long-term retention.

### Pricing / Plan Selection
- Preserve decision-critical comparison points (feature gaps, limits, support terms).
- If emphasizing a default plan, keep alternative plans clearly accessible.
- If showing monthly breakdown pricing, also show total cost and contract terms.

### Paywall
- Design with hard-gate vs soft-gate variants in mind.
- Include gain-framed copy as a standard option.
- Use visuals to reinforce value context, not just decoration.

### Checkout
- Remove unnecessary account creation and heavy input before purchase.
- Improve visibility of payment options and discoverability of switching paths.
- Show transparency copy (returns, cancellation, billing conditions) early.

### PDP / LP
- Produce both feature-first and benefit-first versions.
- For dedicated landing pages, align messaging to traffic intent and reduce branching.
- Before adding new perks, improve visibility of existing benefits.

## Output Format
Always return UI creation proposals in this structure.

```markdown
## Goal
- [Primary user action this screen should drive]

## Target User and Context
- [Who arrives here and in what state]

## UI Variants
- Variant A: [Structure and intent]
- Variant B: [Structure and intent]
- Variant C (optional): [Balanced option]

## Copy and Elements
- Headline:
- Supporting copy:
- CTA:
- Trust signals:

## Expected Impact and Evaluation
- Primary metric: [CVR / completion rate / etc.]
- Secondary metrics: [drop-off / support tickets / retention / refunds / etc.]
- Guardrails: [Conditions that prevent trust or quality regression]
```

## Guardrails
- Do not ship a change based on revenue uplift alone; include quality metrics (churn/refund/NPS).
- Avoid dark patterns (misleading emphasis, hidden terms, or ambiguous conditions).
- Treat simplification as a method, not a license to remove decision-critical information.
